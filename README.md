# CDMS Continuous DAQ
CDMS-DAQ contains code used by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Lab to continuously acquire voltage measurements from an NI6120 digitizer.

It is still in the very early stages of development, and not considered ready for use.

Planned improvements include:
+ Web interface (likely implemented in React with a Flask backend)
+ Independent command line module for use in scripting.
+ More documentation, agressively extensible classes.


Preliminary documentation can be found [here](./doc/_build/html/index.html)
